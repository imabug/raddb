# Overview
The Department of Radiology and Radiological Sciences is primarily responsible for performing annual inspections of imaging equipment used at MUSC and satellite facilities, excluding those used in the College of Dental Medicine. Because of the quantity of equipment that needs to be tracked, an inventory management system is required to maintain a current list of equipment, where it is and the surveys performed on the equipment.

# Purpose
The purpose of the application is to
* maintain an accurate inventory of equipment that needs to be tested
* maintain the list of surveys and calibrations performed on the units
* provide reports to physicists, techs and administrators on the status of the units

# Requirements
Below is a list of requirements, tasks and functions that the application must perform.

## Inventory

Requirements for tracking the installed base of imaging/non-imaging equipment.

### Imaging equipment

Maintain ongoing inventory of imaging equipment and associated components. Track the following information:

* All equipment
  * Modality
  * Manufacturer, model, serial number
  * Manufacture date
  * Install date
  * Department, location, room number
  * Description of the unit
  * Testing frequency
  * Biomed site ID

* X-ray Units
  * Tube housing model and serial number
  * Tube insert model and serial number
  * Date of manufacture
  * Date of installation
  * Focal spot sizes
  * DHEC Shielding log numbers

* Gamma cameras
  * For units with CT capability, all items under X-ray Units

* Ultrasound
  * Probe frequencies, serial numbers

* MRI

The following functionality is required for inventory related tasks

* Add imaging equipment and x-ray tubes (if applicable)
* Delete imaging equipment and associated x-ray tubes
* Modify information about the machine and associated x-ray tubes
* Make inactive (for machines that are taken out of service but not removed)

### Non-imaging equipment
Non-imaging equipment includes CR readers, well counters, thyroid probes, diagnostic workstations and other types of equipment used in radiology requiring routine QC, but does not produce images.

* Add
* Delete
* Modify

### Test equipment
Test equipment includes any meters and ionization chambers that require routine calibration.

* Add
* Delete
* Modify

## Survey information
For units that require regular/annual surveys, the following information for each survey is recorded

* Survey date
* Survey ID (generated by the database)
* Accession number
* Survey notes
* Survey type

The following functionality is required.
* Add new survey
* Add generator data
* Add/resolve recommendations
* Add service report

## Reporting
### Survey reports

 * Store survey reports
 * Display survey reports

### Service reports
 * Store service reports
 * Display service reports

### Inventory reports

* Inventory by location
* Inventory by modality
* Individual unit listing

### Recommendation reports

* List outstanding recommendations

### Dashboard

* Listing of all equipment colour coded by most recent survey date

### Equipment reports


## Administration

This section is used to maintain the lookup tables
* Modalities
* Locations
* Manufacturers
* Testers
* Test types
* Equipment contact people

For all of these tables, must be able to view, add, modify, and delete items.

## QA/Survey Data

Provide a method to display QA/survey data stored in the database. A limited subset of survey data is stored for radiography and fluoroscopy units. Other modalities including mammography and CT will be added at a future date.

For survey data, show
 * List of machines with survey data
 * For machines with survey data available, show what data is available
 * Trend graphs
 * Year to year comparison
 * Comparison between machines
 * Comparison by modality
